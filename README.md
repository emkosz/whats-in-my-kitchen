A program that helps to keep stack on the food stuffs in the kitchen. 

Hi!

This program aims to help users keep check on the food stuffs in their kitchen by letting the user add and delete food that are avaliable or are running out. The program stores a list of food stuff in a file between runs that makes it possible to print a list of what's available and/or what is running out. It's also possible to search for specific food items. For now the program is only readable in the console. 

I made this program during an academic introduction course to programming at The Royal institute of Technology in Stockholm. This is my first progrm in Pyhon and it made a lot of fun writing.
